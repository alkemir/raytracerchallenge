Hello traveller. This repo contains my exploration of building a 3D renderer based off `The Ray Tracer Challenge` by Jamis Buck, a fun read.
It is not intended to be optimal, smart, clean, etc... just my ramblings as I learn something new, something old and something stolen. If
this is something that interests you, I invite you to follow along the commit history, it might save you having to do some typing (although
research has found it is essential for learning)

To show off the capabilities of the renderer, see this image which is the result of chapter 5:

Then, in chapter 6 we added light sources and their consequences according to the Phong model:
