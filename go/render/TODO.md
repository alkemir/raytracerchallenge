List of things I left to do later:

* Optimize code
* Implement bounding boxes
* Adaptative antialiasing
* Patterns for groups
* Provide better test failure messages
* Provide utility methods for tests, like assertEqual()
* Move code into packages like patterns, shapes, scene...
* Implement triangle meshes
